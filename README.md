              Hello everyone, it is Adinda speaking here. Here, I will be showcasing all the works I have done for the second semester of Computation in Design. Expect to see a lot of colors here because putting colors in everything is my style. I hope you enjoy these works as much as I enjoy making it. Until next time!

            NFT Coffee</h2>
            <p>
              For coding, my teammates and I chose to do NFT artworks. We chose this brief because as designers, we actually do not morally support NFT. However, it is something that is currently going on right now, so we might as well learn about it. Our NFT artwork is inspired by our morning routine to get coffee before class, therefore we drew different types of morning beverages (e.g.: coffee, matcha, breakfast smoothie) alongside crypto-inspired copywriting. The result came out like how we wanted to even though there are a few improvements needed to be made. Overall, I do not think I’ll ever do NFT seriously but it was a very fun experience.

            <p>
              For screening, we were inspired by Tame Impala’s visuals. Tame Impala is a musical group focusing on 70s alternative music with extreme psychedelic visuals. Each of us came up with our own sketches from last year, then transformed it to look more trippy and psychedelic. We did this by mainly changing the colors to bright orange, pink and yellow. The result didn’t come out like how we wanted it to, because the laptop and internet suddenly went off. Thankfully, we already had a pre-screen recording of it but this is really something to take note of for the future.

            <p>
              Through this project, we learned how to transform numbers into physical objects. It is like making a cuboid but more advanced. We created the shape by changing the numbers in the code Dhiya has given to us, transferred it to Blender for the layout, printed it out and built the shape from scratch. However, I printed it on A4 instead of A3. While it is still fine and manageable to do, I kind of wished I had bigger shape to hold because mine looks really tiny amongst everyone’s.

            <p>
              The main thing that we learn for this workshop is that no matter where we are and what we do in ife, physics plays an important role in our life. In this case, electricity. To combine both art and electricity, we decided to do a 3D miniature museum. We took inspiration from a video we saw online and decided to recreate it. To create the form, we built a pyramid-like structure with normal paper, then drew the sides as if it was a gallery wall. We put the light underneath the pyramid that is supposed to project  over the artworks.

              As an extrovert, one main thing that I really like and am grateful of from this subject is the social aspect. Most of the time, we were teamed up into groups of two or more and it was a lot of fun. While learning, we also learn about each other. I'll take Open Studios as an example. Contradicting to what most of the other students say, I actually really enjoy gallery sitting. I live alone and I love to host people. Gallery sitting for Open Studios feel like I am hosting people and getting them to know our works is very satisfying to me.

              <b>Some of my most interesting findings this semester are</b>: How coding can be applied to a lot of things. Through coding, we can generate NFT artworks, create a concert set, build an advanced cuboid, combine it with electricity, etc. It goes on and on and on.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>What are some of my achievements?</b> I feel like I have achieved so much in this class not in the way that my works are a hundred percent nice, but in a way that I am really enjoying every second of it. For the first time in five years, I actually don't feel stressed by going to school. Being here has been one of the reasons why I am at my happiest stage in life yet. To me, being happy and grateful with where I am and what I do is equivalent to being successful. Truly a moment to cherish.
